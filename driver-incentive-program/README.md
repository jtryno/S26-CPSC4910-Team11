# Good Driver Incentive Program
## Senior Computing Practicum | Spring 2026

The Good Driver Incentive Program is a cloud-based web application designed to incentivize and improve on-road performance within the trucking industry. The platform allows sponsoring companies to reward drivers with points for positive behavior, which are then used to purchase products from a curated catalog.

## Project Backstory
Our team is hired by an entrepreneur to build this incentive service "on spec". We are responsible for the development, maintenance, and administration of the system in a realistic professional setting. In exchange, our company receives 1% of the total sales generated by the system once it moves from development to production.

## Tech Stack & Architecture
The system follows a traditional 3-tier architecture:

* **Client:** Responsive web application accessible via FF, Chrome, or Edge
* **Web Server:** Cloud-hosted server using technologies such as NodeJS, Apache, or IIS.
* **Database:** Cloud-hosted relational data store (AWS RDS) using MS SQL, MySQL, or Oracle.
* **Hosting:** Fully deployed within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment.
* **External Integrations:** Product catalogs are maintained in real-time via public Web APIs such as eBay or Etsy

## User Roles & Operations
The application serves three distinct user types:

* **Drivers:** Apply to sponsors, earn points for good behavior, and redeem points for rewards from a sponsor-specific catalog.
* **Sponsors:** Organizations that manage driver applications, award/deduct points, and curate product catalogs via automated web APIs.
* **Administrators:** Platform managers who oversee all organizations and users, while generating cross-sponsor financial reports and invoices.

## Key Requirements
* **Agile Management:** Project managed via Microsoft Azure DevOps using Git for configuration control.
* **Audit Logging:** Continuous tracking of point changes, login attempts, password updates, and driver applications.
* **Security:** Enforced password complexity, encryption of data at rest, and protection against SQL injection.
* **Reporting:** Visually appealing data visualization for sales and point tracking with CSV download capabilities.
* **Responsive UI:** The application layout is responsive and conforms to the size of the user's display.
